              <b>IZARA - Technical Engineer</b>
            <br></br>
                ERP Systems are at the core of every company. More and more firms implement cloud-driven ERP solutions by providers like SAP or Microsoft.
                Business processes depend on a functioning IT environment and a good understanding of modern ERP Systems is crucial when working in IT.
                AT PwC and Capgemini, I have seen how IT consultants work and I have realized that much of their work is concerned with Project management, rather
                than technology. Instead of increasing the knowledge of IT systems and concrete software, many consultant seem to build project management skills
                in particular. However, I strongly believe that you need a very good understanding of technology to make the right business decisions and to consult
                firms properly. This is why I am particulary happy about landing this student job at IZARA. In this position, I am responsible for the Application
                Management of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations system of three companies. This position gives me the opportunity to develop my
                technical skills and increase my understanding of ERP systems. I very much enjoy working with engineers and consultants on technical issues and I am
                glad that IZARA has given me this work opportunity.

              <b>PricewaterhouseCoopers - IT Consultant</b>
            <br></br>
                After I got first insights in project management and the Internet of Things technology, I could not wait two learn more about
                emerging technologies. PwC gave me the opportunity to participate in the audit of SAP's cloud solutions and thus I got to know
                the basics of Cloud Computing as well as how a big software corporation assures the trust service principles security, availability and
                confidentiality. During the audit, I was mainly involved in auditing the SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud but also supported other teams
                in auditing S/4 HANA, ByD and IBP. My internship covered not only planning but also execution and completion of the entire audit.
                I learned a lot about Cloud Computing, project management and cloud audits during my time at PricewaterhouseCoopers.

              <b>Capgemini Consulting - IT Consultant</b>
            <br></br>
                Business & Technology Innovation! After I graduated from University I applied for different technology related internships.
                As a student assistant at BCG I was mainly responsible for supporting employees using different technologies and fixing software
                issues. However, I was still intrigued my emerging technologies that change business processes, business models and even whole
                companies. Therefore, I joined the Technology Consultancy Capgemini to learn more about relevant technologies. I got to know various
                IoT solutions, which are already implemented in the manufacturing industry. We wanted to find out: What is possible? How
                comprehensive and how complex are the current IoT services? Which industry is leading? Furthermore, I got involved in a
                digital transformation project at BMW in Munich. I became more familiar with project management and how technology projects
                can be implemented in a multinational manufacturing corporation. I mainly worked on the IT concept as well as the roll-out
                concept and I undertook various ad-hoc tasks in the course of the project.

              <b>The Boston Consulting Group - IT Specialist </b>
            <br></br>
                During my bachelor's program of Economics and Business Administration I realized that my study program and my personal interests
                do not match completely. As I am passionate about emerging technology and digital business, I was dissatisfied with the number of
                available tech classes in my university. I wanted to get a better understanding of information systems and how technology is used
                to improve business processes. Consequently, I was looking for a student job that is very much related to technology and I found
                it in the IT Department of one of the most recognized management consultancies in the world. As a student assistant in the IT
                Support of BCG in Frankfurt, I had various responsibilities and tasks. You can find a summary of my tasks in my resume.
