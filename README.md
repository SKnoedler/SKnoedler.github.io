## About

This is actually my second personal website that I have coded. The first one was a bit more personal but I have decided to redo my website and start from scratch again.

If you have time check out my portfolio to see iPython notebooks and look for other Github repos to find other projects that I have done in the past. Feel free to connect on LinkedIn or get in touch if you want to discuss opportunities, collaboration, consulting or have a heated debate about Data Science and Tech. I’m always happy to chat!

You can find a contact form on the homepage, or send an email directly to st.knoedler@gmail.com
