              <b>Emerging Technologies</b>
              <br></br>
              How will new technologies change the way we live our life and how will it change the way companies operate? What is possible in the
              future and what is already possible with emerging technologies? <br></br>
              I am intrigued by new technologies. I always watch the keynotes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google as those three corporations
              currently lead the market of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence. Usually, their developments have a noticeable impact
              on the tech market and their showcase projects often show what is possible to accomplish by technology today. For instance, Google
              recently hold the annual Goolge I/O keynote and showed developers and other participants how the Google AI can have real life
              conversations with strangers (Google Duplex). The AI is apparently capable of talking to people naturally and scheduling appointments
              without leaving room for doubt that this voice is not an actual person.
            <br></br>
              However, also other technology projects amaze me and I read thousands of articles to develop a good understanding. Currently, I
              read a lot about the Tangle and Blockchain technology as those technologies seem very promising, but companies still do not really
              know how to leverage their potential. All in all, it is very exciting to see the development of digital technologies and I would love
              to help companies take full advantage of new digital tech.

              <br></br><br></br>
              <b>Consumer Technology</b>
              <br></br>
              Consumer technology is tangible and therefore very exciting for me. I can take advantage of consumer technology and I am affected
              by new releases and updates. I watch tech reviews and I subscribed many tech blogs to not miss any news about hardware, such as
              Notebooks, Tablets, Smartphones, smartwatches, TVs, and software, such as Android, Windows and iOS. For me it is not important
              whether I consider buying those products – I am a tech geek and therefore excited about almost every new technological product
              that (might) come into the market soon. <br></br>
              However, I am also concerned about technology monopolies, consumer privacy and the handling of confidential data. Technological
              products develop rapidly but the adequate political framework is usually implemented significantly later than product release. A
              society must deal with this issue and technology firms need to act responsible.
              <br></br><br></br>
              <b>Renewable Energy, Electric Vehicles & Smart Cities</b>
              <br></br>
              In the past two years, I read a lot about renewable energy, electric vehicles and even smart cities. It is exciting to see how
              technology can increase our efficiency to fight the wastage of natural resources. I am very interested in technology that has
              the potential to slow down climate change and creates an environment where it is more enjoyable to live in. It shows me that
              technology does never stand for its own – it is rather connected to people, to the environment and other technology. Only if we
              achieve a perfect interaction of different technology, we can leverage the full potential of each individual technology. For
              instance, wind turbines can make a greater impact if we are able to store energy because our power grid is easily overstrained
              in the case of heavy wind and we might be forced to waste the produced energy. Electric vehicles could use the stored energy and
              we do not need to use nonrenewable energy sources. It decreases pollution and increases the quality of life.
              <br></br><br></br>
              <b>China & International Affairs</b>
              <br></br>
              Made in China 2025 strategy describes an “initiative to comprehensively upgrade Chinese industry”. China is currently investing
              heavily all around the world.  China wants to become the world leader in almost all high-tech industries and seems to be on a good
              way. I am very interested in the strategy of the Chinese administration and how the country promotes growth. It is exciting to see how
              China secures resources and establishes new trades routes - how heavily they invest in European and American companies, how Chinese
              firms are doing business internationally and how international companies try to do business in China. I am asking myself: How
              dangerous are Chinese investments? How much do we depend on China and how much will we depend on China? I personally believe that
              China will become the most important international business partner of almost every multinational cooperation. I would like to learn
              more about the Chinese culture to understand them better; Not only becuase I am inetrested in foreign cultures, but also to prepare
              for a closer business collaboration.
